    <h3>
      Idli or idly is a type of savoury rice cake, originating from the Indian
      subcontinent, popular as breakfast foods in Southern India and in Sri
      Lanka
    </h3>
    <p>
      The cakes are made by steaming a batter consisting of fermented black
      lentils (de-husked) and rice. The fermentation process breaks down the
      starches so that they are more readily metabolised by the body. Idli has
      several variations, including rava idli, which is made from semolina.
      Regional variants include sanna of Konkan.

    <p>
      A precursor of the modern idli is mentioned in several ancient Indian
      works. Vaddaradhane, a 920 CE Kannada language work by Shivakotiacharya
      mentions "iddalige", prepared only from a black gram batter. Chavundaraya
      II, the author of the earliest available Kannada encyclopedia, Lokopakara
      (c.1025 CE), describes the preparation of this food by soaking black gram
      in buttermilk, ground to a fine paste, and mixed with the clear water of
      curd and spices.[1] The Western Chalukya king and scholar Someshwara III,
      reigning in the area now called Karnataka, included an idli recipe in his
      encyclopedia, Manasollasa (1130 CE). This Sanskrit-language work describes
      the food as iḍḍarikā. In Karnataka, the Idli in 1235 CE is described as
      being "light, like coins of high value", which is not suggestive of a rice
      base.[2] The food prepared using this recipe is now called uddina idli in
      Karnataka.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Rice</li>
      <li>Dal</li>
      <li>Chilli Pepper</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Parboiled rice idli</li>
      <li>Ground udad dal</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps to make</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Rinse urad dal and fenugreek seeds in water for 2-3 times</li>
      <li>
        Soak urad dal, fenugreek seeds and poha (flattened rice) together in
        1-cup water for 4-5 hours. (Dal’s size and volume would increase to
        almost double after soaking.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Rinse both parboiled and basmati rice together in water for 3-4 times.
        (Place both types of rice in a large bowl and fill it with water till
        ¾th height. Rub rice grains between your fingers; this will make water
        turn cloudy. Drain the water and repeat the process for 3-4 times to
        rinse them properly.) Soak them together in 2-cups of water for around
        4-5 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain excess water from soaked urad dal and reserve it to use in
        grinding process in next step. Transfer drained dal and fenugreek seeds
        into large jar of mixer grinder or wet grinder.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 1/2 cup water (preserved in step-4) and grind until smooth texture.
        Gradually add more water (as needed) and grind until smooth and fluffy
        texture. To grind 1/2 cup urad dal, you would need approx. 1½ cup water.
        The amount of water required greatly depends on the quality of urad dal;
        so add water gradually and only as required. Ground dal mixture should
        have light and fluffy texture as shown in photo and it should not be
        very thin or very thick.
      </li>
      <li>Transfer it into a large container.</li>
      <li>
        Add water in small quantities as needed (approx. 1/2 cup total) and
        grind until slightly coarse texture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer ground rice mixture to the same container in which urad dal
        mixture is stored.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add salt and mix it well. Batter should not be very thick or very thin.
        Idlis will turn hard if batter is too thick, and idlis will turn flat if
        batter is too thin. Cover it with a plate and keep it in warm place (at
        room temperature in summer, and in warm place in winter) for 8-10 hours.
        If you are living in cold place, place the batter in oven and keep the
        oven light on.
      </li>
      <li>Size and volume of batter would increase as it ferments.</li>
      <li>
        Stir the fermented batter with a clean ladle or a large spoon. You
        should see the tiny air bubbles in the batter as shown in the photo.
        These tiny air bubbles are critical to make idlis soft and spongy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Check batter for salt and if required, add more salt and stir. Pour 1-2
        glass water in the steamer and place it on the stove to heat over medium
        flame. Grease idli moulds with oil and pour batter over it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place moulds in the steamer. Cover steamer with a lid and steam the
        idlis for 10 minutes over medium flame. Check whether idlis are cooked
        or not by inserting a knife or a toothpick in the center of idli take it
        out. If it comes out clean, it means idli is cooked; if it doesn’t, then
        idli is not cooked yet; steam it for 3-4 minutes more and check again.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove idli moulds from the steamer and let them cool for few minutes.
        Remove idlis with a wet spoon; this will help you remove it easily from
        the mould.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer them to a plate or in a casserole and cover with a lid to keep
        them hot. Serve hot with sambar and coconut chutney in the breakfast.
