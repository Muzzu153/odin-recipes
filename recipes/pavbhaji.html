    <h3>Pav Bhaji is one of the most tastiest indian dish</h3>
    <p>
      Pav bhaji (Marathi : पाव भाजी) is a fast food dish from India consisting
      of a thick vegetable curry (bhaji) served with a soft bread roll (pav).
      Its origins are in the state of Maharashtra.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dish originated as a fast lunchtime dish for textile mill workers in
      Mumbai. Pav bhaji was later served at restaurants throughout the
      city. Pav bhaji is now offered at outlets from simple hand carts to
      formal restaurants in India and abroad.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Potato</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Tomato</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps to make</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Pressure cook the cauliflower and potato until tender (with some water)</li>
      <li>Mash well and set aside</li>
      <li> Heat oil and add capsicum. Fry lightly until soft.</li>
      <li>Add ginger and garlic and saute for a few seconds</li>
      <li>Then add chilli powder and turmeric, fry for 5 seconds and add the mashed vegetables. Mix well.</li>
      <li>Add tomato puree and bring to boil. I sometimes use diluted tomato paste, pureed fresh tomatoes, or canned tomato puree/sauce. All of them work very well.</li>
      <li>When tomato sauce cooks, it makes a god-awful mess so I prefer to let it cook closed. So as soon as the mixture boils, add pav bhaji masala and peas along with about 1 cup water.</li>
      <li>Keep covered and cook for about 15 mins.</li>
      <li>Add butter and salt and mix well.</li>
      <li>Check consistency and add more water if required and boil further.</li>
  </ol>
